Twi is a danbooru clone written on Node.js/Express and Bootstrap
----------------------------------------------------------------
Basic functionality is present but I would at best put the
project at an early beta status.

The comments, notes, artists, and tags sections haven't been
touched but the stuff that involves them in the other tabs is
essentially done, they just need routes and templates.

### Features Implemented:
Transparent Imgur storage

### Planned:
Similar transparent support for AWS
File hashing to prevent duplicate posts
    (Is only available on direct storage mode currently.)
A setup script
Admin functionality (It's currently nonexistant)
